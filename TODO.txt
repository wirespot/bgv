FLEXIBLE RENDERING
?? function that translates point from canvas system to system relative to bb
!! function that translates point from rel to bb to canvas
    using a certain bb canvas placement and zoom
!! calculators conversion
    !! bb becomes [0, 0]
    !! change all calculators to produce values relative to bb
        ** Util functions should still work, since axes and angles retain
            their signs in the bb-relative system of coordinates
        ?? stop rounding everything to int
        ** stop applying zoom
!! renderers conversion
    !! canvas coords are found using a reference point and a zoom value
    ?? round floats to int before rendering
!! correctors conversion
    !! stop using zoom undo
!! labels conversion
    !! canvas coords are found using a reference point and a zoom value

GENERAL
* draw seat post, saddle
* add standover def and attempt to draw the real top tube
? draw real down tube
* Logger object, print to scrollable textarea instead of console
* ability to check if wheels level without fixing it
* define stack x reach spot and draw them from that spot, so tilt on leveling becomes noticeable
* how to deal with stuff that depends on horizontal/vertical after a leveling tilt
    (stack, reach, top tube, seat and head angles, wheelbase)
    FIXME: forkTrailSpot is moving after tilt, shouldn't have to
* single bike diagnostics:
    report def params that were not originally available but were computed
    toe overlap
    seat tube tire clearance
    front crown tire clearance
    bb height
* relative bike diagnostics:
    compare delta at alignment reference spot
