{"name":"Bicycle Geometry Visualiser","tagline":"Visualise and compare bicycle geometries.","body":"**Bicycle Geometry Visualiser (BGV)** is a tool that allows you to define the geometry of one or more bicycles, see them rendered graphically on an HTML5 Canvas and perform visual comparisons by aligning several bicycles over each other. This can help you choose or compare frames and bicycle models.\r\n\r\n**For now BGV lacks a user interface** and you will need to edit JavaScript files to make use of it. A user-friendly graphical interface is planned, but other features come first.\r\n\r\n**To use BGV**, checkout the code and load _index.html_ in a recent web browser (only tested with Firefox). Bicycle and parts definitions are in _lib/definitions.js_ and you can control the rendering from _lib/control.js_.\r\n\r\n**Feedback is welcome.** Please keep in mind that this is a very young project and the author's spare time is limited.\r\n\r\n**Feel free to hack on it** and reuse the code (BGV is licensed under GPL v3), I am hoping that some of the graphical and trigonometrical libraries can be useful to others as well.\r\n\r\n**Here are some examples** of what you can do with it:\r\n![Example rendering of a road bike.](https://raw.github.com/wirespot/wirespot.github.io/master/images/road.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
