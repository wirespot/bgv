{"name":"Bicycle Geometry Visualiser","tagline":"Visualise and compare bicycle geometries.","body":"**Bicycle Geometry Visualiser (BGV)** is a tool that allows you to define the geometry of one or more bicycles, see them rendered graphically on a HTML5 Canvas and perform visual comparisons by aligning several bicycles over each other. This can help you choose or compare frames and bicycle models.\r\n\r\nFor now BGV lacks a user interface and you will need to edit JavaScript files to make use of it. Features planned in the future include bicycle vs cyclist diagnostics.\r\n\r\nTo use BGV, checkout the code and load index.html in a recent web browser (only tested with Firefox). Bicycle and parts definitions are in lib/definitions.js and you can control the rendering from lib/control.js.\r\n\r\nFeedback is welcome. Please keep in mind that this is a very young project and the author's spare time is limited.\r\n\r\nBGV is licensed under GPL v3.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
